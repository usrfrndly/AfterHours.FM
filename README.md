AfterHours.FM
=============

iOS App for AfterHours.FM
Built in Swift and Objective-C, AfterHours is an iPhone app that streams the popular eponymously titled Norwegian Radio Station. For this application, I also built an equalizer that allows users to tweak the sound of the streamed audio, by  manipulating CoreAudio data.
